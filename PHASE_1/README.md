# Ideas & Grouping

> **Suggested Timeframe:** 2 days
>
> **Note:** You are not expected to start coding during this phase

### Objective

By the end of this phase, each group should have;

- a project Idea
- a list of requirements
- decided on a project management tool

### Teams

Teams should be balanced, so that each group will have a mix of skills (design / frontend / backend).

The team will share responsibilities but will define roles:

- **Project Manager** - Responsible for team communication and co-ordination. The Project Manager should organize any team meetings and should ensure the group stays on track.
- **Repository Maintainer** - Responsible for enforcing correct GIT processes, such as ensuring team members are not directly committing to the main / master branch, and that new features are added using the PR (pull request) system.
- **Lead Frontend Developer** - Responsible for co-ordinating the front-end tasks and for providing support to the other frontend developers. Ideally the lead frontend developer would be the most experienced frontend developer in the group.
- **Lead Backend Developer** - Responsible for co-ordinating the backend-end tasks and for providing support to the other backend developers. Ideally the lead backend developer would be the most experienced backend developer in the group.

> ðŸš© At this stage, avoid having an idea owner, where one person makes all the suggestions / decisions. Ideas should be malleable

> ðŸ¥¨ New groups may form around ideas, instead of groups based on previous friendships

### Create feature list

- What problem are you solving with your application?
- What can the user do with it?
- Create MVP (minimum viable product) feature list project roadmap (what we want to achieve by the end of the 7 weeks if everything goes as planned)
